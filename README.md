### Hi there friendðŸ‘‹

I'm Citlali!

ðŸŒ± I'm an early riser, early sleeper, and an energetic artist! I earned my BS from MIT in athematics and Computer Science in 2019, and am always learning about something new. Ask me about e-volunteering with [CodePath.io](https://codepath.org/) or my extensive reading goals! Fun fact: I hold triple citizenship in the USA, Mexico, and Poland :-) Oh, and my pronouns are she/her/hers

I'm currently reading (3/21):

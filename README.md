### Hi there friendðŸ‘‹

I'm Citlali!

ðŸŒ± I'm an early riser, early sleeper, and an energetic artist! I earned my BS from MIT in Math and CS in 2019, and am always learning about something new. Ask me about e-volunteering with [CodePath.io](https://codepath.org/) or my extensive reading goals! Fun fact: I hold triple citizenship in the USA, Mexico, and Poland :-) Oh, and my pronouns: she/her/hers

I'm currently reading (3/21):

- Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler
- Data Sketches by Bremer and Wu
- White Fragility by Robin DiAngelo
- Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari
